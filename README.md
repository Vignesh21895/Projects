About Me

I am a passionate Cloud Engineer specializing in automation, infrastructure-as-code, and cloud-native solutions. With hands-on experience in Azure and a strong focus on scripting and DevOps practices, I build efficient and scalable tools to simplify complex cloud operations.

Alongside cloud engineering, I am actively exploring the integration of Artificial Intelligence into day-to-day cloud workflows to enhance automation, decision-making, and operational efficiency. I am also diving into prompt engineering—crafting effective AI prompts—to better leverage AI models and tools within cloud environments.

My goal is to continually learn and implement cutting-edge cloud and AI technologies while sharing my projects openly to contribute to the community. This repository serves as a collection of my practical work and automation scripts that demonstrate my expertise and problem-solving approach.

Feel free to explore my projects and connect with me on www.linkedin.com/in/vignesh-suresh-kumar-6640ba197 to discuss collaboration or opportunities.
